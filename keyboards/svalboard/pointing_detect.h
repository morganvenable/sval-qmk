// Find which pointing module is attached, whatever the firmware was built for.
//
// The Svalboard's pointing modules share one connector but each uses its own pins and
// protocol: trackball (PMW3360/PMW3389, SPI on GP24-27), Azoteq trackpad (IQS5xx, I2C on
// GP16/17) and TrackPoint (PS/2 on GP23/24). When a build's own module doesn't answer,
// these probes check the others, so a host can name the right .uf2 (Sval 0x2C).
//
// The probes toggle the pins directly instead of using the chip's SPI/I2C/PIO
// peripherals, so they work in any build. They take each pin from whatever peripheral
// had it, so only run them when the build's own module didn't answer. GP25 is the
// trackball's chip select and the TrackPoint's (undriven) reset line: it's only pulled
// up, never driven, until the last probe (SPI), which runs only when PS/2 and I2C found
// nothing.
